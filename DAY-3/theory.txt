Java Type Casting

Type casting is when you assign a value of one primitive data type to another type.

In Java, there are two types of casting:

***** Widening Casting (automatically) *****

- converting a smaller type to a larger type size
Widening casting is done automatically when passing a smaller size type to a larger size type:

byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double

********  Narrowing Casting (manually)  ********

- converting a larger type to a smaller size type

Narrowing casting must be done manually by placing the type in parentheses in front of the value:

double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte
